## Dependencies
The `scout_v2_isaac` package has been created and tested under Ubuntu 22.04. This is research code, expect that it changes often and any fitness for a particular purpose is disclaimed.

## How to use 
### Simulation setup
First, you need to open the terminal and create a ROS2 workspace
```
mkdir -p scout_ws/src
```
go to the src folder and clone the repository
```
cd scout_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/leonlime/scout_v2_isaac.git
```

build the package
```
cd ..
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
colcon build
```
### Running the simulation
Open the terminal, navigate to the workspace you created before and source ROS2. Donâ€™t forget, **always before opening Isaac Sim**, the first thing to do is start a terminal and source ROS2 Humble.
```
cd scout_ws
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
```
Open `Isaac sim`, inside Isaac sim, change the extension `ROS BRIDGE` to `ROS2 HUMBLE BRIDGE`. Open `scout_v2_simulation.usd` file and click in Isaac Play button.

Go back to the terminal and check the ROS2 topics
```
ros2 topic list
```
To visualize the camera images, LiDAR and odometry, open Rviz
```
ros2 launch scout_v2_ros2 scout_v2_rviz.launch.py
```
You can navigate using teleop twist command
```
ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard
```

#### PS: If this simulation is too heavy for your PC. You can try disable left and right camera plugin.
